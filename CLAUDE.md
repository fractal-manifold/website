# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is the Fractal Manifold corporate website - a static site built with Astro showcasing the company's startup investment and AI research activities. The site is deployed to GitHub Pages with a custom domain (fractalmanifold.com).

## Development Commands

### Development
```bash
npm run dev        # Start dev server at http://localhost:4321
npm start          # Alias for npm run dev
```

### Building
```bash
npm run build      # TypeScript check + production build to dist/
npm run preview    # Preview production build locally
```

**Important**: The `dist/` folder is **NOT** committed to Git. GitHub Actions builds it automatically on push.

## Architecture

### Project Structure
- **`src/pages/`**: Route pages (index.astro is the homepage)
- **`src/layouts/`**: Base layout with global styles and font imports
- **`src/components/`**: Reusable components (Header, Footer)
- **`public/`**: Static assets served as-is (favicon, CNAME for GitHub Pages)
- **`dist/`**: Build output (generated by GitHub Actions, not in Git)

### Design System

**Color Palette** (defined in `src/layouts/Layout.astro`):
- Black background: `#0A0A0A` (primary), `#1A1A1A` (secondary)
- Gold accent: `#F59E0B` (primary), `#FBBF24` (light)
- Purple accent: `#9333EA` (primary), `#A855F7` (light)
- Text: `#FFFFFF` (primary), `#D1D5DB` (secondary), `#9CA3AF` (muted)

**Typography**:
- Display font: "Bruno Ace" (imported from Google Fonts, used for all headings)
- Body font: System font stack
- Headings use `--font-display` CSS variable

**Gradients**:
All gradients use a specific pattern to avoid muddy intermediate colors:
```css
linear-gradient(135deg,
  var(--color-gold) 0%,
  var(--color-gold) 30%,
  var(--color-purple) 70%,
  var(--color-purple) 100%
)
```
This creates a 30-70 split with sharp transition, showing more pure gold and purple rather than blending into reddish tones.

### Component Patterns

**Feature Cards** (used in startup/research sections):
- Use "background icon" pattern: large emoji (8rem) at 15% opacity positioned absolutely on the right
- Content wrapped in `.feature-content` with `position: relative; z-index: 1`
- Structure:
  ```html
  <div class="feature">
    <span class="bg-icon">🚀</span>
    <div class="feature-content">
      <h3>Title</h3>
      <p>Description</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  ```

**Buttons** (hero CTA buttons):
- Both primary and secondary use ghost/outline style by default
- Fill with gradient/solid color on hover
- Always include `transform: translateY(-3px)` on hover for consistent interaction

**Header**:
- Fixed position with backdrop blur
- Logo split into two gradient spans: "Fractal" (gold) and "Manifold" (purple)
- Uses `white-space: nowrap` to keep logo on single line

## Deployment (GitHub Pages)

The site deploys to **fractalmanifold.com** via GitHub Pages using **GitHub Actions**:

### Automatic Deployment
- Push to `main` branch triggers `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
- GitHub Actions automatically:
  1. Checks out code
  2. Installs dependencies (`npm ci`)
  3. Runs `npm run build`
  4. Deploys `dist/` to GitHub Pages

### Manual Workflow
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Update website"
git push origin main
# GitHub Actions handles the build and deployment automatically
```

**Note**: The `dist/` folder is **ignored** in Git - it's built automatically by GitHub Actions.

### Configuration
- **Workflow**: `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
- **Domain**: `public/CNAME` contains `fractalmanifold.com`
- **Site URL**: `astro.config.mjs` has `site: 'https://fractalmanifold.com'`

### GitHub Pages Settings
Repository Settings → Pages:
- Source: **GitHub Actions**
- Custom domain: `fractalmanifold.com`

## TypeScript Configuration

Uses Astro's strict TypeScript preset with `strictNullChecks` enabled. All `.astro` files are type-checked during build via `astro check`.
